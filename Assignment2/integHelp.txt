Usage: ./numIntegration [optional command] T N [optional argument]

numIntegration:
Calculates the numerical integration of [4/(1 + x^2)] from 0 to 1 by summing up areas of trapezes.
[0 1] is divided into 'N' trapezes and their areas are calculated and summed by 'T' threads parallely.

{Implemented for testing different work distribution} -- Optional argument 'P' can be used to break each section of trapezes into smaller partitions. Threads can pickup blocks to calculation.

Required Inputs: 
  T	Number of Threads. (a natural number)
  N	Number of Trapezes. (a natural number. N should be greater than or equal to T)

Optional Argument: 
  P	Number of Partitions. (a natural number. N should be greater than or equal to T*P)

Optional Command: 
  -h	Display this information.
